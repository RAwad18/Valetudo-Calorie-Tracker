# Calorie-Tracker (Valetudo)

Valetudo is a web app that allows the user to log their foods and track their total calories and macronutrient consumption.
- It allows users to search for thousands of foods, thanks to the **Nutritionix API**.
- Choose from a variety of different serving sizes
- See the calorie and macronutrient content per food item
- Customize your caloric and macronutrient goals

## Goal

The goal behind building this app was to complete my very first "real" project. Something that involved a frontend, backend, API calls, and a bunch of other terms that I had no idea what they truly meant.

I'll be the first to admit that this project could use a TON of improvement. However, I'm still extremely proud of it and I believe that it fulfilled it's purpose.

This project was the all-important stepping stone that catapulted me forward in my programming journey. Through it, I gained valuable experience working on both the frontend and backend.
- Worked with React and Redux - understood the concept of state vs stateless
- Developed my very first backend server - understood routes, controllers, and middleware
- Wrote and retrieved data to a database for the first time in a project setting (MongoDB)
- Worked with my very first API's - Mongoose, Nutrionix
- Designed my own REST API

It allowed me to understand these concepts in a way that no amount of words could ever hope to do. It also taught me how the frontend and backend communicate, and how the very concept of 'frontend' and 'backend' is contextual.
